Static Map
==========

This application provides a wrapper around Google static and dynamic map APIs
in a single interface. Given a list of coordinates, it builds the URL for
loading a map image from Google Static Maps. When clicked on the map image,
it loads the dynamic version of the same map, with the markers intact.


Dependencies
------------

StaticMap requires the jQuery library (any version after 1.2 will do) and
the jQuery Class plug-in (http://github.com/taylanpince/jquery-class). A 
Google Maps API key is also needed for it to run properly. All Google
JavaScript libraries are loaded dynamically so they don't need to be included
separately.


Installation
------------

From your media folder, create a symlink to the dist directory under the
static_map path:

    ln -s ../lib/static_map/dist media/static_map

Make sure CSS and JS files are loaded on the templates where you will use 
Static Map:

    <style type="text/css">
        @import "{{ MEDIA_URL }}static_map/css/static_map.css";
    </style>
    
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}static_map/js/
        static_map{% if not DEBUG %}.min{% endif %}.js"></script>


Usage
-----

StaticMap class takes a selector and a dictionary of options:

    - api_key: Google API key, required for both static and dynamic maps
    
    - size: Dimensions of the map as an array
    
    - center: Central coordinates of the map, as an array
    
    - zoom: Zoom level of the map
    
    - markers: An array of markers, each identified as a dictionary:
    
        - coordinates: Coordinates of the marker, as an array
        
        - title: A title for the marker, will only show up on a dynamic map
        
        - description: A description for the marker

    - media_url: A string that will be apended to media file paths

After creating the container for the map, instantiate the class with options:

    <div id="MapArea"></div>
    
    <script type="text/javascript">
    //<![CDATA[
        new trapeze.StaticMap("#MapArea", {
            "api_key" : "<GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY>", 
            "size" : [298, 298], 
            "center" : [41.9288, -87.6315], 
            "zoom" : 10,
            "markers" : [
                {
                    "coordinates" : [41.9228, -87.6632],
                    "title" : "Title 1",
                    "description" : "Description 2"
                },
                {
                    "coordinates" : [41.9228, -87.6632],
                    "title" : "Title 2",
                    "description" : "Description 2"
                }
            ]
        });
    //]]>
    </script>
